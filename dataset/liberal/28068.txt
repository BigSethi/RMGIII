now is the second kind of person – and i don’t think zmirak would have had any trouble recognizing the trump of say the howard stern show interviews as the second kind – really the sort of man you would expect to make a good job of the presidency on the contrary supposing that trump is battered by a legion of devils who prey upon his pride who exacerbate his mood swings who encourage rash decision making and pointless fights – wouldn’t that be a pretty good reason to look to the 25 th amendment which clearly has a penumbra or an emanation relating to demonic infestation and vest the presidency’s powers in the boring evangelical staidness of mike pence instead
