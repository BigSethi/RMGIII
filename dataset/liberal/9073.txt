thats thanks to trump victories in winner take all states such as florida where trump won all 99 delegates even though he got 46 percent of the vote and south carolina where he received all 50 delegates even though he had just 32 percent of the vote and winner takes most states such as new york where he likely will wind up with 95 percent of the delegates while garnering 60 percent of the popular vote
