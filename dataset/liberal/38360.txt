will someone explain to president elect donald trump who has threatened to “outmatch” rivals in a new nuclear arms race that one cannot “win” such a race that even the “losers” in the race accumulate nuclear weapons sufficient to end civilization as we know it and that therefore the measure of an american president’s success in nuclear strategy is his ability to discourage such races from occurring in the first place
