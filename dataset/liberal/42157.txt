i am interested in these groups because they have better that is non cynical reasons for backing trump than do many of the leaders of his party’s establishment and also because i agree them on some of the congeries of issues that make up “trumpism” not comprehensively but even where we differ i generally get where they’re coming from – and because i get it i am particularly frustrated that they are so badly misjudging the man in whom they’ve placed their trust
