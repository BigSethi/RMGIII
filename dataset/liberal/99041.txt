later that month during a visit to one of his golf courses in scotland a reporter asked trump whether he would be okay with a muslim from scotland coming into the united states and he said it wouldnt bother me afterward spokeswoman hope hicks wrote in an email that trumps ban would apply only to muslims in states with high risks of terrorism but she would not say whether the ban would also apply to non muslims from those countries or to muslims living in peaceful countries
