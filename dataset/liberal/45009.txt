from the moment whitaker was appointed nadler told me “it was clear that trump wanted him to be his hatchet man” when whitaker comes before the committee nadler said he will ask him “have you told mueller not to follow some line of inquiry have you told him not to indict somebody what instructions have you given to him if any have you communicated with the white house about these matters in any way or with the president’s lawyers in any way what have you told them those kinds of questions”
