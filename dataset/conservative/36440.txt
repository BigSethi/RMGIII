jim antle at the week notes that in the wake of president trump stepping back from the ledge liberals already are shifting targets from migrant children being detained to families being detained at all its the latest sign of how in recent years democrats have with little fanfare moved dramatically to the left on immigration and with trumps presidency theyre becoming further radicalized their left flank wants them to abandon even a nominal commitment to immigration enforcement where previous generations of liberals including labor unions worried about low wage immigrants competing with other americans todays dominant concern is the fact that immigrants are disproportionately people of color meaning any enforcement will have a disparate impact on racial minorities
