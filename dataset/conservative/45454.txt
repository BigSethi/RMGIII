having already accused president trump of virtually every crime under the sun the mainstream news media are now labeling him a racist says ben shapiro at national review believing this demonstrates their willingness to speak truth to power but despite the fact that he does make racist statements it isnt fact based reportage it is by its very nature opinion besides the media find the courage to call people racist only when they disagree with them politically yet calling trump racist alleviates the requirement to honestly assess his actions and statements and they can then pillory anyone who disagrees as a representative of broader american racism bottom line applying the racist tag to trump as a human being isnt journalism
