itd be easy to call donald trumps transition a mess for the president elect says matthew cooper at newsweek but for one thing trump is getting what he wants he notes its unlikely any of his cabinet nominees will be rejected by the senate yes several nominees took issue with some of trumps enunciated positions but trump has backed off some of his more controversial stances so the differences between what his nominees stated and what trump has stated isnt as great as had been implied moreover on any number of other issues trump is likely to get enough of what he wants to claim victory so he looks poised for a lot of victories despite critics underestimating him which come to think of it sounds pretty familiar
