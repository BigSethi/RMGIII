but unless they flip at least 46 seats which seems unlikely at this point their majority would be smaller than the current gop majority and anything short of 60 seats means that it would be a real challenge for house democrats to get much out of the chamber as for the senate it currently looks like a democratic tidal wave crashing up against a republican seawall the reality he says is that neither party is going to exceed 53 or 54 seats making for a tough legislative sled and even if democrats win big president trump still wields the veto pen bottom line expect legislative paralysis to get even worse than it is today
