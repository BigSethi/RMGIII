so what can be learned from the new hampshire primary that it doesnt hurt to be the loudest mouth in the room at least if you are trying to appeal to republican voters that four and five letter words that were once considered taboo in civilized circles are now perfectly acceptable on the stump that bravado and crassness have replaced substance and character in this political season that average citizens on either side are just so angry and disillusioned that they would vote for anyone who isnt named clinton or bush that the primary season has only just begun but the end seems ever so near that life as we know it is over the jurassic period of donald trump is at hand
