say what when trump announced that he could not trust judges of mexican heritage to be neutral did that further rule of law values when trump announced that he favored torture of terrorism suspects did that crude dismissal of the fourth amendments ban against unreasonable seizures reflect rule of law values whatever one can say about the election i doubt that americans voted for trump to reinstate a rule of law and i doubt that law professors voted against trump because of their view of the living constitution presser should accept that law professors like a majority of voters voted against trump for a wide variety of reasons that include his political inexperience and demagoguery
