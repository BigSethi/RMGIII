forget about the impeachment of president donald trump in fact rebuilding american politics and indeed all of american public discourse is going to take a while because trump is only a symptom of the fundamental brokenness of american politics not the cause electing a democratic congress and impeaching trump neither of which is going to happen might feel good in the moment but wouldnt actually fix what is broken resistance to this president must be more than the handmaiden or enabler of a political party that has lost its power lost its voice and lost its way
