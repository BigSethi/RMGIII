national reviews jim geraghty notes that a large contingent of conservatives on twitter really wants to believe that whoever has been sending explosive devices to democrats and other targets is someone on the left who is trying to make trump supporters look bad that cant be ruled out he says but its rather bizarre to hear the absolute adamant insistence that this could not possibly be a bomber who identifies himself as being on the right or as a supporter of the president after all there are idiots and nut jobs all across the political spectrum and quite a few who dont fit neatly on it bottom line we live in a world that is unpredictable scary and often doesnt make much sense
