as bloombergs jonathan bernstein notes trump also takes questions in impromptu groups of white house reporters and does sit down for extended interviews with individual reporters but is that enough and would it really be a big deal if formal news conferences disappeared no theres nothing special about them but bernstein still believes theyre an institution worth saving because they at least guarantee that a president will be exposed to tough questions from independent reporters on a somewhat regular basis they also stand for democratic values of openness in government and the idea that the president works for the people rather than ruling over them
