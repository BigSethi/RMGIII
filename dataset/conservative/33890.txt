luther strange in the alabama primary runoff but winner roy moore was clearly the trumpier of the two candidates says the weeks simon maloy given his backing from pretty much every other cog in the ramshackle trump political machine so the key question raised by this bizarre primary is how much does trumpism actually require trump his movement acted directly against the wishes of its leader moores win says maloy shows us that trumpism will outlast trump because it doesnt need him as senator roy moore will cause gop leader mitch mcconnell endless grief and theres nothing trumpier than that
