jay caruso who became a republican during the clinton era declares at the atlantic that hes not going to let donald trump force me out of the republican party the gop he concedes was never perfect and never will be but when donald trump whom he opposed was elected i didnt become a blind trump partisan defending him at every turn nor did i become a blind trump critic opposing him at every turn even though trump has inflicted wounds on the gop that will take a long time to heal caruso is not about to abandon the party as some conservatives have done
