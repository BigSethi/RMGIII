voxs laura mcgann says she still gets e mails from many progressive men who didnt see the fall of al franken over sexual misconduct allegations as the loss of a democratic senator but rather as the loss of a progressive icon and she adds they havent moved on moreover they dont get why franken is out of a job when say donald trump isnt or why i include franken in stories about powerful men whove been accused of monstrous behavior they argue that his behavior wasnt that bad but mcgann responds it is that bad and while there are differences between harvey weinsteins behavior and frankens that doesnt mean women should have to choose between the two
