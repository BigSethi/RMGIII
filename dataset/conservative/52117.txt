my personal history with this attitude goes back to the days of jimmy carter who openly proclaimed himself to be born again a phrase taken from the mouth of jesus which caused many republican evangelicals to vote for him in 1976 but not in 1980 when he ran against ronald reagan a divorced man who rarely attended church but whose policies much like those of president donald trump were lauded by evangelicals
