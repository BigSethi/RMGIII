if president donald trump had to be judged by the same standards as other people in sensitive white house jobs would he have qualified for a security clearance or would his alleged affairs with women other than his wife including two who reportedly received large payments to keep quiet and the women who have accused him of misconduct have made him too much of a risk what about his questionable business practices and financial connections or just his hidden tax returns would any of those things even have allowed him to get a white house job in the first place besides president of course
