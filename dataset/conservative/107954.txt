why is it that when donald trump makes radical statements regarding muslims the press and many of his competitors suggest he speaks for america and that he sullies our international image and makes it more difficult for our leaders to do business with our allies yet when radical iranian muslim leaders shout death to america we are urged to be reasonable show restraint and understand that this is just the lunatic fringe of the muslim community and should not be taken as mainstream muslim ideology
