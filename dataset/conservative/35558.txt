indeed the debate over trump taking place among college republicans mirrors the national intra party one it pits young conservatives who view trump as a distraction from long held conservative goals against those who see trumps distinctive message as a much needed adjustment of the partys priorities most college republican groups which did not endorse him may have accepted trump as president but they still arent committed to his vision so what now seem like low stakes debates on college campuses will ultimately come to define the partys future because if trumpism has a political future these young people will likely be its torchbearers
