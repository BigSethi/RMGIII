marc thiessen at the washington post says vladimir putin actually deserves some credit hes turned the democrats into russia hawks which is more than any of his murderous soviet predecessors were able to accomplish sure todays dems are deeply concerned about the threat russia poses to our democracy but during the cold war when the soviet union posed an existential threat to our democracy not so much indeed most democrats opposed ronald reagans policies that led to the fall of soviet empire and heaped scorn on his blatant anti communist rhetoric in 2012 mitt romneys focus on russia was considered laughable by most democrats so lets hope their newfound antipathy for russia is not just a convenient way to get to president trump because the threat will be there when trump is gone
