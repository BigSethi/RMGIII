we didnt know it 20 years ago says the washington posts dana milbank but in bill clinton were the seeds of donald trump in fact clintons handling of the monica lewinsky scandal was a precursor to the current prez dismissing unpleasant facts as fake news self righteously claiming victimhood attacking the press and cloaking personal misbehavior in claims to be upholding the constitution sure standards have changed since 1998 but if a democrat behaved today as clinton did then it wouldnt be dismissed as bimbo eruptions hed be drummed out of office as former senator al franken was for his behavior but this is larger than metoo when clinton disgraced the office with personal misconduct and lies we didnt pause to think what might happen if an utterly unscrupulous man became president
