david harsanyi at the federalist finds it ironic to see so many of the same liberals who recently fought to prop up iran the worlds most powerful jew hating terror state lecturing us on the importance of combating anti semitism some even decided to dip into a little victim blaming suggesting american jews are too pro israel for their own good one even demanded that jews start expelling their pro trump co religionists for their political opinions but undermining the democratic party isnt an act of anti semitism not when its liberal activist resistance wing is being led by a couple of louis farrakhan fangirls if youre not upset about the vile accusations incessantly thrown at benjamin netanyahu but think calling out george soros is de facto anti semitism your main concern is liberalism not the jewish people
