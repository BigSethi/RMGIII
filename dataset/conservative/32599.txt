indeed it dramatizes every one of his themes but none more spectacularly than this his claim that his opponents will not defend the borders of the united states and while its crazy for trump to suggest the caravan is led by democrats hes not wrong to sense that they are massively discomfited by it especially since his fulminating and conspiracizing deters any democratic leader from saying or doing anything that could be interpreted as agreeing with him but make no mistake if liberals insist that only fascists will defend borders then voters will hire fascists to do the job liberals will not do
